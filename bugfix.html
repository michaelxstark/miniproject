    <p> While going through the tasks on how to clean the data from Wikipedia I realised,
      <br>that after the completion of step two there where people missing in the list. </p>
    <p> I couldn't wrap my head around how that could happen since I'm not too familiar with backreference <br>
    in regex. </p>
    <p>But since I had some time yesterday and a great amount of fun in the course over all, <br>
    I took a closer look at the regex and found the thing, that let people from the list go missing. </p>
    <p> Since the regex is always referencing to the two stars at the beginnig of the lines that don't have a seperate date -
      <br> since two or more people died on that specific day - it starts overwriting lines when it gets executed the second <br>
      (or third I can't remember correctly right now) time. I couldn't solve the problem with regex alone, so I tried a solution in <br>
    python which looks like this and which works to substitue steps 2 and 3 in the cleaning of the data from Wikipedia. <br>
    (Since I'm using a code prettifier, the &ndash gets displayed as the actual single character <br>
    not the string of characters as I had it in the original code)</p>
    <div class="codebit">
    <pre>
      <code class="python">
        import re
        import sys

        s = sys.stdin
        so = sys.stdout
        xs = s.readlines()
        xss = ' '
        xsss = xss.join(xs)
        y = re.findall("\* \[+\w+ \d+\]+\n", xsss)
        d = 0
        clean = ''
        for i in range(len(xs)):
            if '**' not in xs[i] and '&ndash;' not in xs[i]:
                if i == 0:
                    d = 0
                else:
                    d += 1
            elif "**" in xs[i]:
                x = re.sub("\*{2} ", y[d].strip('\n') + " &ndash; ", xs[i])
                clean += x
            else:
                clean += xs[i]
        so.write(clean)
